## üß∞Ô∏è pzsvrtool
Did you...
- thought that running a docker on that expensive VPS is so wasting on your already limited paid resources?
- suddenly thought of doing a shutdown on the current restart countdown so you can apply some quick changes?
- saw those huge backup zip files, thinking it did be nice to be smaller so you can have more on your already limited resources?
- Tried VPS with virtualization securities that prohibit you from using some PZ tools because it uses some fancy ways to detach and attach PZ?
- get annoyed that some PZ tools doesn't restart because it couldn't detect unlisted mods updates, mods that you don't want others to use?
- get annoyed that your scheduled restart occur right after a mod update restart?
- hate it that when you try to update Zomboid but some PZ tools don't help you backup nor restore the previous modified `.json` or `start-server.sh`?

Well, I do and I waited but these tools never get updated so I made my own, much easier and cleaner. All in all, pzsvrtool is made by server owner for server owners.

## üêß Supported Platforms
Tested on Almalinux 9.5. Theorically the scripts should work in all linux enviroments as long the followings are met<details>
<summary>Dependencies</summary>
Should come installed with linux but just incase

- `bash`
- `procps`
- `findutils`
- `coreutils`
- `gawk`
- `util-linux`
- `tar`

Need to install

- `wget`
- `lz4`
- `python3`
- `python3-psutil`
- `python3-bcrypt`, dnf requires `epel-release` repo to install
- `sqlite` or `sqlite3`
- `tmux`
- SteamCMD dpendency varies slightly on distro. On apt is `lib32gcc-s1`. On dnf is `glibc.i686`. I don't know about `pacman` or `swupd`.

</details>

## üßê General usage
The scripts should provide all basics you need to run a linux PZ server.
- If you need to do scheduled restart, you can add `pzsvrtool restart --backupgrace 120` to crontab schedule
- If you want to periodically check mod updates, you can add `pzsvrtool checkmodupdate` to crontab schedule

## ‚úÖ Features
- Able to detect unlisted mod update
- Always running unless explicitly shutdown
- Compresed backup with up to 10x smaller than PZ zip, highly recommended to disable PZ backup
- Bootloop detection to prevent unnecessary compressed backups thus data losses due to backup limits
- Console that looks like the real deal while able to scroll with page up, page down, arrow up and arrow down
- Countdown for restart and shutdown
- Unnecessary scheduled restart prevention option
- Reliable linux utilities used to run PZ in background
- Kick players before restart or shutdown to minimize data loss from PZ poor saving mechanic
- Numerous checks to prevent multiple PZ instances
- Change user password
- Reset zombie population
- Auto backup start-server-sh and ProjectZomboidXX.json when updating PZ with option to auto revert them
- Supports discord webhook to be informed of bootup, shutdown, backup, restart, bootloop and checkmodsneedupdate status

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Support the work

I pretty much made this for a community server of mine which is totally community funded. If it went dead then I don't see a point in maintaining the script as well.

## üíª Installations
For Fedora / RHEL / Rocky Linux / AlmaLinux, download RPM and run `sudo dnf install <rpm file name>` then run `sudo dnf install python3-bcrypt python3-aiohttp glibc.i686`, accept key if asked.

For Debian / Ubuntu, download DEB and place it in `/tmp` then run `sudo apt-get install /tmp/<deb file name>`.

You are not allowed to run this as root so do `sudo useradd --create-home --shell /bin/bash <username>` and `sudo passwd <username>` to set password. Do `sudo -i -u <username>` to quick switch from root to target user. In the new user account, do `pzsvrtool install` to install then `pzsvrtool start` to launch your server.
